    <h1>About our project</h1>
	Justin Strauss and Derek Tsui <br>
	Software Development Period 7 <br>
	MongoDB Project <br>
 <br>
	This project is a blog manager with the following pages: <br>
 <br>
	1. A login page - /login <br>
	2. A logout route that logs you out and brings you back to index - /logout <br>
	3. A register page - /register <br>
	4. At least one page that can be viewed without logging in - /index <br>
	5. At least 2 pages that can only be viewed if you are logged in. - /profile and /contacts <br>
 <br>
	If you're logged in, all pages indicate this by displaying your username in the upper left hand corner along with a link to logout. If you’re logged out, the upper left hand corner will simply say “Account Manager” along with a link to the login page. <br>
 <br>
	If you go to a protected page and you're not logged in, it redirects you to the login page. Once you log in (or register then login) it redirects you back to the protected page. <br>
 <br>
	The protected profile page allows you to change your account password. <br>
 <br>
	Tools used in addition to basic Flask: <br>
 <br>
	1. Mongo to store the accounts - username, password, and email. <br>
	2. Sessions - to keep track of the state. <br>
	3. Flashing - to display one time error messages like invalid password. <br>
